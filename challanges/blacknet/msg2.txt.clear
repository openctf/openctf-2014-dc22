Hello BlackNet.

I've got a source you wouldn't belive for advance information on stocks. It
would be difficult for me to make use of this myself, but perhaps we can work
out an arrangement. The first one is free - here's some stuff that will be
annonced on Monday.

* MCI is making $1.3B investment in Nextel.
* H&R Block's earnings report better than expected.
* Aetna Life & Casualty's earnings estimate reduced by $120M due to LA quake
  and harsh winter storms.

Get back to me on Tuesday with an offer for more like this.

I'll include the following at the end of future messages so that you may
identify me:
